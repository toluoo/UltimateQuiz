This is a web application for a trivia game. There are 6 categories to choose from and 10 questiions every time you play. The questions are pulled from an API: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php. The score is updated with each correct question as well as a question counter.

This is one of my first experiences using an API so it was a little bit difficult to understand but I was able to gain understanding of how it works now. In the future, I would like to add difficulty levels, sound effects, more categories, a timer and a high score page.

All the files are contained within the master branch. The app can be started by opening the index.html file in any browser. There should be a home page with a title and play button that takes you to the category page where you can choose the category and play!
